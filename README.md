Repository for work I'm doing to support [The Al'Kabor Project](https://www.takproject.net/).

Lutris Install Script
--------------------
I've submitted the script to be included in the Lutris search for EverQuest; however, it seems like it can take awhile to get approved. Even then, I wasn't able to submit specifics, such as the `slug_name`.

I will update this once/if it is approved.
